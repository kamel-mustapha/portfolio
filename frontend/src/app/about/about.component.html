        Hi there !

      <p class="text-gray-300 text-2xl mt-8">
        Hello, my name is Kamel. After earning a master's degree in
        telecommunications, I began my career as a network engineer. However, I
        discovered my true passion for software development and web development.
        Now, I'm fortunate to be living my passion as a full-time full stack
        developer.

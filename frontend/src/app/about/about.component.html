        Greetings, I am Kamel. Following the completion of my master's degree in
        telecommunications, I embarked on a professional journey as a network
        engineer. Subsequently, I identified my genuine enthusiasm for software
        development and web development. Presently, I am privileged to be
        immersed in my passion as a full-time full-stack developer.
